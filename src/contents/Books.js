        <p>Frankl argues that meaning emerges not from pleasure or power, but from how we respond to unavoidable suffering. Writing from Auschwitz, he observes that those who survived had something to live for: a task, a person, a future worth enduring hell for. The insight cuts through therapeutic abstractions: meaning isn't found, it's chosen.</p>

        <p>What strikes me most is his refusal to romanticize trauma. Suffering doesn't automatically create meaning. Only our response to it does. This reframes every setback as a choice point: will this break me or reveal what I'm capable of? The book became my compass during difficult periods, not because it promises easy answers, but because it insists we always retain the freedom to choose our stance.</p>

        <p>---</p>

        <p>"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms: to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."</p>

        <p>"Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'."</p>

        <p>"When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves."</p>

          Hawkins argues intelligence is prediction, not pattern matching. The neocortex runs one hierarchical, sparse algorithm everywhere: modeling sequences, anticipating next steps, correcting errors. This theory unifies perception, action, and understanding under a single framework: building and maintaining a temporal world model.
        </p>

        <p>
          The challenge to modern ML is direct. Scaling transformers isn't the same as building a cortex. Real intelligence requires temporal structure, top-down prediction, sparse composition, and continual learning. Not labeled datasets and static distributions. Even as LLMs improve, the gap remains: they fit patterns, not maintain models that self-correct in real time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The arguments lack formal rigor and implementation detail, but that's acceptable. A sharp theory that directs inquiry beats scattered heuristics. This provides orientation. Specific enough to test, practical enough to build from.

        <p>Ikigai locates purpose not in grand callings but in daily rituals: tea with neighbors, morning walks, communal dance. Garcia and Miralles study Okinawan centenarian to show how meaning emerges from consistency, not ambition. Purpose becomes social, not heroic.</p>

        <p>The book's weakness is its reluctance to prescribe. "Follow what excites you" is true but insufficient without mechanisms. It describes the state but not the path. Still, the reframing matters: purpose as ember rather than explosion, maintained through small acts rather than singular breakthroughs.</p>

        <p>Chōmei catalogs 12th-century disasters: fires, famines, earthquakes, then retreats to a hut. The disasters are vivid but serve only as preamble. The hut life, which should be the core, offers no meditation on solitude or its effects on consciousness. At 2,000 words, it gestures toward impermanence without developing the thought. If you want Buddhist philosophy or hermit wisdom, this isn't it.</p>

        <p>Seierstad embeds with Sultan Khan's family to map post-Taliban Kabul. The strength is specificity: how daughters resist within constraints, how Khan reconciles old loyalties with new freedoms, how a bookshop becomes contested ground between tradition and change. The personal renders the political legible. Afghanistan's transformation visible in one household's tensions.</p>

        <p>The prose stays spare. Details accumulate without ornament, building understanding through accretion. Strong narrative journalism. Empathetic but unsentimental.</p>

        <p>Knight's memoir strips away the myth of Nike's inevitability. What emerges is contingency: cash flow crises, supplier betrayals, lawsuits, near-death moments. The company survives not through vision but through stubborn endurance and improvisation. The lesson isn't about passion or purpose. It's about continuing when stopping seems rational.</p>

        <p>His management philosophy is anti-bureaucratic: set direction, then get out of the way. Trust people to solve problems you didn't anticipate. The book's power is in its honesty about fear, failure, and the randomness of success.</p>

        <p>Santiago pursues omens across deserts only to find his treasure buried where he started. The allegory is transparent: searching reveals what was always present. Coelho's prose is simple and lyrical, effective for parable. The disappointment is structural. The ending arrives abruptly, deflating the journey's momentum. The idea works better than the execution.</p>

        <p>Gibran offers poetic meditations on love, work, freedom. Each chapter self-contained, metaphor-dense, accessible. The fragmentary structure suits contemplation but resists cohesion. No argument develops; wisdom accumulates without resolution. The lyrical depth compensates somewhat, but the lack of progression or closure limits its impact.</p>

        <p>Seven stories of men navigating absence: widowed surgeons, reserved bartenders, all processing loss through memory and silence. Murakami's surrealism stays subtle; the emotional landscape precise. Each protagonist confronts the impossibility of return: places, people, selves all shift imperceptibly. The prose is spare, the affect subdued. Strong on mood, light on event.</p>

        <p>Tartt builds an insular academic world: Greek rituals, Vermont winters, a tight circle of students who commit murder. The atmosphere is thick, the psychological suspense real. The weakness is indulgence: ornate prose, long introspections, details that slow momentum. The moral unraveling is compelling but could be sharper. Still, the obsession and guilt land. Dark academia as a study in how isolation breeds extremity.</p>

        <p>Each time something disappears from the world, the protagonist gains a day of life. The conceit has potential. What would you sacrifice for time? But the execution is unpolished. The prose feels rushed, dialogue simplistic, themes underdeveloped. A few moments of tenderness between owner and cat work, but regret and redemption never deepen. Quick, under 200 pages, forgettable.</p>
