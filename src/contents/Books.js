          Hawkins strives toward a singular, all-encompassing theory of intelligence centered on the neocortex, which he claims is a memory and prediction system running one algorithm that is hierarchical, sparse, and sequence-centric, replicated everywhere. The book is a unifying lens. Once you adopt it, perception, action, and “understanding” reduce to modeling the world and predicting what comes next.
        </p>

        <p>
          The value here is the bridge. He reads the neocortex as a working spec and asks ML to honor its rules: time, hierarchy, feedback, sparsity, continual learning.
          On ML and AGI, the take is clear. Scaling pattern matchers is not the same as building a cortex. We need architectures that learn <i>temporal</i> structure, use top-down prediction as a core signal, represent knowledge sparsely and compositionally, and learn continuously without labels. Even if modern LLMs blunt some of his 2004 criticisms, the framework raises the bar for intelligence: not just fitting distributions, but maintaining a world model that anticipates and corrects itself in real time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The arguments are light on proofs and sometimes hand-wavy on implementation. Still, I would rather have a sharp theory that orients my engineering than a bag of heuristics with no north star. This book offers that orientation, a single theory of intelligence that is specific enough to disagree with and practical enough to guide design.

        <p>Ikigai reframes the familiar “follow your passion” mantra into a living practice, rooted in Okinawan longevity and small town rhythms. It’s not a panacea or a productivity hack, but a gentle invitation to tune into what makes each morning worth waking up for.</p>

        <p>I liked the way Garcia and Miralles peel back ikigai’s cultural layers: tea gatherings, neighborhood dance circles, morning walks, showing how small rituals weave purpose into daily life. These vignettes aren’t glossy success stories, they’re snapshots of real people finding meaning in the mundane. Purpose here isn’t a solitary Everest to conquer but a communal flame to share.</p>
        
        <p>That said, the book sometimes drifts into platitudes. “Move toward what excites you” feels obvious without deeper tactics. I’d have liked a tougher edge, exercises that force you beyond reflection into action. Still, Ikigai’s quiet wisdom lives in its patience. It won’t yell at you to hustle harder, but it will remind you why a steady ember beats a wildfire.</p>

        <p>What begins as a promising survey of 12th-century Japanese disasters—fires, famines, plagues—quickly devolves into a disappointingly shallow memoir.</p> 
        
        <p>I slogged through half the text expecting substantive Buddhist teachings, only to find the centerpiece is a bare-bones recounting of Chōmei’s move into a hut. There’s virtually no exploration of what solitude means or how it shapes the mind—just terse observations that feel half-baked. At barely 2,000 words, it’s over before it begins, leaving me frustrated rather than enlightened. If you want genuine insight into Buddhist philosophy or the hermit’s path, look elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Seierstad delivers a rigorously reported, deeply nuanced portrait of post-Taliban Kabul through the lens of Sultan Khan's family and bookshop.</p>
        
        <p>Her reporting—grounded in immersive, on-site observation—illuminates both the city's sensory textures (the aroma of newly printed volumes, the cadence of evening prayers) and the complex dynamics within Khan's household.</p>
        
        <p>I found the interweaving of political context and personal narrative particularly effective: daughters' acts of quiet defiance and Khan's internal struggle embody Afghanistan's broader social transformation.</p>
        
        <p>The prose is precise and unembellished, ensuring that each detail advances understanding rather than ornamentation. This book stands out as a model of narrative journalism—compelling, empathetic, and essential for anyone seeking a substantive account of contemporary Afghan life.</p>

        <p>Coelho’s allegorical journey is beautifully rendered, with Santiago’s quest through deserts and omens resonating as a universal metaphor for purpose. The prose is clear and often lyrical, lending depth to themes of destiny and self-discovery. Yet I found the conclusion unexpectedly understated: instead of a transcendent climax, Santiago unearths his treasure at home, leaving a sense of abrupt finality. While the novel’s core message—that the real journey lies within—remains powerful, the ending felt too succinct, as if the promise of something grander was left unrealized.</p>

        <p>“It’s not what enters men’s mouths that’s evil,” said the alchemist. “It’s what comes out of their mouths that is.”</p>

        <p>"Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place."</p>

        <p>Gibran’s collection of poetic essays delivers timeless insights on love, work, and freedom with a simplicity that feels both spiritual and accessible. Each chapter reads like a standalone meditation—rich in metaphor and quietly profound—allowing readers to pause and reflect. Yet the very fragmentary structure, while beautiful, can feel disjointed, and the final poem offers wisdom without a true sense of closure. I appreciated its lyrical depth, but the abrupt ending left me yearning for a more cohesive resolution.</p>

        <p>This seven-story collection examines male solitude and the echoes of loss with Murakami’s signature blend of subtle surrealism and emotional clarity. From the widowed surgeon in “Drive My Car” to the reserved bartender in “Scheherazade,” each protagonist navigates absence through memory and silence. The prose is spare yet evocative, drawing readers into quietly resonant inner worlds. A concise, insightful exploration of masculinity and isolation.</p>

        <p>Tartt’s novel excels at conjuring an intoxicating academic world—its precise descriptions of classical rituals and ivy-clad seclusion drew me in immediately. The slow-burn build-up of tension, punctuated by that infamous winter kill, showcases her talent for psychological suspense. Yet I found the prose occasionally overindulgent: lengthy introspection and ornate detail sometimes stalled the narrative momentum. While the characters’ moral unraveling is compelling, a leaner edit would have sharpened the impact. Still, its dark-academia allure and thematic depth make it a memorable, if imperfect, exploration of obsession and guilt.</p>

        <p>The novel’s central conceit—losing one day of your life each time a cat vanishes—has genuine emotional potential, but the execution feels unpolished. The prose reads like a rough draft, with awkward turns of phrase and simplistic dialogue that at times felt childlike rather than contemplative. That said, it’s a brisk, under-200-page read, and a few chapters capture moments of genuine tenderness between owner and pet. Ultimately, though, its themes of regret and redemption remain underdeveloped, and I was left wishing for deeper character arcs and sharper writing. A light, quick read—but not one I’ll revisit.</p>
